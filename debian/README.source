Information about maven-resources-plugin
----------------------------------------

This plugin is a core Maven plugin, if you update it to a new upstream release
the superpom in the maven2-core package must be updated to specify the new
version of the plugin. This pom is bundled in a jar built by the maven2 package,
so the maven2 package has to be rebuilt after installing the updated maven2-core
package.


This package was debianized using the mh_make command
from the maven-debian-helper package.

The build system uses Maven but prevents it from downloading
anything from the Internet, making the build compliant with
the Debian policy.
